This repository contains a Python module that generates random mouse movements within a specified range. The X position of the mouse is randomly chosen between 500 and 700, and the Y position of the mouse is randomly chosen between 100 and 800. The function uses the pyautogui library to move the mouse cursor.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```pip install pyautogui```

## Usage
The function will run indefinitely until the program is stopped.
